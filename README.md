<h1>Full Stack Developer Portfolio: Showcasing My Skills and Projects</h1>
<p align="justify">This is my first portfolio, which showcases my skills as a full stack developer. 
I developed this portfolio between March 31, 2023, and April 16, 2023.</p>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p align="justify">In this portfolio, I have showcased my skills and projects as a full stack developer. 
On the frontend, I have used HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to create a visually appealing and responsive design. 
Additionally, I have incorporated Vanilla JavaScript and jQuery to add interactivity to the site.
<br>
On the backend, I have used Spring Boot to create a scalable and modular architecture. 
I have implemented Spring Security for authentication and authorization. Maven has been used for dependency management, and MySQL has been used as the database.

Overall, this portfolio demonstrates my proficiency in a range of frontend and backend technologies 
and serves as a testament to my abilities as a full stack developer.</p>
